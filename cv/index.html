	<h1></h1>
	<p>Believe it or not,  I do not have any prior education in programing or web design.</p>
  <p>In this day and age, with information so easily attainable, anyone can find what they are wanting to know right in the palm of their hands.</p>
  <p>With Youtube tutorials and the Google search engine, nothing is out of reach. </p>
  <p>If you are interested in programming send me an email.  I will gladly share what little knowledge I have with you.</p>
